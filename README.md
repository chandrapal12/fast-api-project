### 🚗 Car Price Prediction

A Machine Learning project that predicts the selling price of a car based on various features such as brand, fuel type, transmission, year, mileage, etc.


### 📌 Problem Statement

Buying and selling used cars can be confusing due to price variations.
This project aims to build a regression model that accurately predicts car prices using historical data.
